Christian Dior is a French luxury brand focused primarily on women's fashion with products such as suits, gowns, bags, perfumes, cosmetics, jewelries and other accessories. The eponymously named Christian Dior, now also commonly known as just Dior celebrates its 70th anniversary this year 2017. And with this celebration comes a new state-of-the-art archive, the “Dior Heritage”, placing importance on sustained meaning, identity, and legacy. This presents a particular case in which normative perceptions of documents, records and archives are overcome as well as flaunting the power of archives in a field such as fashion.


Schwartz and Cook wrote “Like archives collectively, the individual document is not just a bearer of historical content, but also a reflection of the needs and desires of its creator, the purpose(s) for its creation, the audience(s) viewing the record, the broader legal, technical, organizational, social, and cultural-intellectual contexts in which the creatorand audience operated and in which the document is made meaningful, and the initial intervention and on-going mediation of archivists.” And this is true for the garments, among other materials, housed in Dior's archive. Initially conceptualized for the wear of the user as well as aesthetic appeal, the garments archived transcend this as they become part of “the look” brought forth by their respective designers and eventually the historic and social foundations of Dior.


“With the web and Instagram, the millennial generation only know fashion now, but not the history of fashion. Sometimes, if you read the comments on the Instagram, you see the people who write are not so informed about the history of fashion. Not just about Dior, but about all the brands. If you have a big story and you want to maintain your iconic element, you need to protect it and speak about it.” says Maria Grazia Chiuri, creative director of Christian Dior. Archives are documents or records with enduring value, and it is this sense of being iconic that endures for Dior. They are snapshots of a period in time in which Dior was Parisian glamour which they aim to preserve and protect.


Maria Chiuri also states"At a brand like Dior, in some way, the designer is important, but what the people really want is Dior. We live in a very egocentric world now, but in the future, what you remember is Dior.” That is the power of the archives, an enduring ideal or concept embedded in material form. In this instance preserved so as to maintain power relations between producer and consumer. The underlying idea here is that through archives, Dior remains in the status quo, preserving its place in the fashion market and ensuring that the brand continues even as directors eventually change.


Though perceived to be neutral at times, the archive is a powerful tool in the hands of skilled archivists. Preserved are memory and identity as well as the power relations intertwined with the documents. Christian Dior is one of many fine illustrations of the possibilities that can be reached through archives.

 Assessment
 
 The paper is a reaction on an archival issue, based off a feature story involving the then newly made Dior archives.
 I believe that the sentiment analysis done on the paper is quite representative of it. The paper showed joy as it was supposed to celebrate the impact of archives in a non traditional manner.
 The language style is analytical, and rightly so, being a reaction paper.
 Social tendencies show openness and extraversion, though not necessarily an intention when the paper was written, is understandable in this circumstance.
 Highlighted sentence concentrations are relatively similar throughout the sentence level analysis, this being a relatively short text.
 The results though appreciated, seem lacking, I feel that there could've been more tones looked for. The at most 5 tones under emotion, language style, and social tendencies respectively, feel too few.
 Overall the applications for this type of analysis shows a lot of potential uses, such as discourse in class and debating whether or not the results are apt.
