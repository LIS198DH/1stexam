Practical exam:

For this exercise, I chose to analyze my tweets.

Data gathering: 
Requested Twitter archive and was presented a csv file. Opened file in Excel and manually deleted all retweets and direct messages/mentions, leaving only my own unfiltered and undirected screaming at the void.
Unfortunately, only IBM Watson’s Tone Analyzer demo was accessible from the lab and it only accepted a limited size input and so I was only able to analyze my latest 500 tweets.

Findings:
According to the Tone Analyzer, joy and sadness are likely present while anger, disgust, and fear are unlikely. This is already wrong as I have very little joy and many of my tweets are about my contempt for the current administration.
It is apparent that 500 tweets should be considered a large dataset and contain such a high variance in tone that a large scale analysis is unhelpful.
Another limitation is that the Tone Analyzer is unable to detect sarcasm which is the most basic of tones a human should be able to detect. Inspecting the results, the tweets marked as “joyful” are actually sarcastic.
Stripped of links, images, and all context, Tone Analyzers are unable to provide analysis comparable to a human skimming through my timeline.
Perhaps tweets are too small and too discrete and a better approach would have been to analyze each tweet individually.
Both Language and Social Tendency have all fields marked unlikely.

Further study: 
Individual analysis of tweets will probably yield more definitive results.
My tweets are timestamped so there is an opportunity to plot my mood swings. I may also link analysis with mentions and be able to find my disposition towards specific users I have tweeted at.
For this, access to the API is necessary. I tried to sign up for an IBM BlueMix account but I think the proxy is preventing the signup page from loading.

FOLLOW UP:

Signed up for an IBM BlueMix account which came with a free 30 day trial. With access to the Tone Analyzer API, I can now automate the requests.
ToneAnalyzer Lite package comes with 2500 free API requests per month and so I had to be more selective with which tweets I was sending.
This time, I omitted all tweets that were less than 10 words, removed all urls and images, and selected the 2480 latest tweets (saving 20 of my allocated API requests for experimentation while coding)
I saved the file as shortlist.xls and used Python to pass each row to the Tone Analyzer endpoint and saved the result as a JSON file.
Below is the code I used:

--

from pyexcel_xls import get_data
from watson_developer_cloud import ToneAnalyzerV3
import datetime

tone_analyzer = ToneAnalyzerV3(
    version='2016-05-19',
    username= #REDACTED,
    password= #REDACTED
)

data = get_data("shortlist.xls")

judgedtweets = []

for row in data['Sheet1']:
    time = row[0]
    tweet = row[1]
    result = tone_analyzer.tone(tweet)
    item = {'timestamp':time,'content':tweet,'analysis':result}
    judgedtweets.append(item)


text_file = open("output.json", "w")
text_file.write(json.dumps(judgedtweets))
text_file.close()

---

The output of the above script is a JSON file containing the text analyses of 2480 tweets. Below are images plotting the resultant probabilities as given by IBM's Tone Analyzer on the Y axis with the X axis being time (latest tweet on the left).

Taken collectively, the result is similar to the 500 Tweet sample from above. However, the increased granularity of the data allows me to correlate tweet mood with external events, spot outliers, and see which are my saddest/angriest/happiest/etc tweets. The exercise also serves as a great introduction to IBM Bluemix and I am excited to try out their other tools while I still have my trial period.
